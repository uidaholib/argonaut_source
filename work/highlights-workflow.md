procedure for creating Argonaut highlights to include a “size” in the file naming convention, information in W:\Argonaut\Highlights

Adding a size will help with a sensible layout of items that is easy to produce. I automate the build process by saving the list of file names from the directory, then use the data imbedded in the file name to generate the items for the web page.

If you want to sign up for a decade, use the argonaut_decades.xlsx

Take snip of something interesting,

Save as PNG following this naming convention:

[id]_[page]_[size]_[type]_[description].png

where:

id = contentdm id (you can find this by looking at the object page URL, for example, http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/argonaut/id/1379/rec/101 the id is 1379)

page = pdf page number

size = use sm, md, lg, xl to indicate the number of columns the highlight should take up in the web page display (horizontal width). sm is 1 column (25% of the news page), md 2 columns (a medium image, two column article, or ad, etc), lg 3 columns (a large image or add, etc), or xl 4 columns (typically a headline that crosses the full paper)

type = use ad, img, head, art to indicate the type of highlight (advertisement, image, headline, or article)

description = descriptive word for the snippet
