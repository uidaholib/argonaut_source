Create image highlights for Argonaut
====================================

We are creating a randomly generated newspaper "front page" for the Argonaut digital collection.
The "front page" is made of interesting snippets from Argo issues through the years.
Users will be able to click on the highlight to go to the Argonaut issue. 

How to help:
------------

Choose an Argonaut decade on the argonaut_decade.xlsx spreadsheet and add your name to the person column. 
You can use the CDM link to jump to all the argo issues for the decade. 
Browse through issues in your decade and take screen shots of interesting highlights. 
You can choose issues at random, or try to find interesting dates and historical events to look for.
See examples in the examples folder in this directory.

Procedure: 
-----------

View an Argo issue in your browser (i.e. the digital object page, for example, http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/argonaut/id/1379/rec/101 ).
Choose a few interesting highlights in the categories of advertisements, images, headlines, or articles (you might have a couple total per issue you look at). 

Use Window's Snipping Tool to grab a screen shot of the highlight. 
Use the Rectangular Snip option to create an image close cropped to the highlight content. 

Save as PNG following this naming convention:

[id]_[page]_[size]_[type]_[description].png

where:
id = contentdm id (you can find this by looking at the object page URL, for example, http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/argonaut/id/1379/rec/101 the id is 1379) 
page = pdf page number
size = use sm, md, lg, xl to indicate the number of columns the highlight should take up in the web page display (horizontal width). sm is 1 column (25% of the news page), md 2 columns (a medium image, two column article, or ad, etc), lg 3 columns (a large image or add, etc), or xl 4 columns (typically a headline that crosses the full paper)
type = use ad, img, head, art to indicate the type of highlight (advertisement, image, headline, or article)
description = descriptive word for the snippet

For example, 
11202_1_xl_head_wsubeat.PNG is a headline on the first page of this issue, http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/argonaut/id/11202

1071_5_sm_ad_urge.PNG is an ad on page 5 of this issue, http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/argonaut/id/1071

Make sure the CDM id (the first number of the file name) is correct, since this is how I will connect the images to their issue and metadata. 

Thank you!
